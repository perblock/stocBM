# stocBM

A set of functions to get the partitions of a stochastic blockmodel for
mobility networks; that is, for a cross-classification matrix in which
rowsums differ between rows AND rowsums and columnsums differ. In other
words, a stochastic blockmodel for directed, weighted networks, which is
conditional on the in- and out-degree distribution.
