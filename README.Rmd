# stocBM
A set of functions to get the partitions of a stochastic blockmodel for
mobility networks; that is, for a cross-classification matrix in which 
rowsums differ between rows AND rowsums and columnsums differ.
In other words, a stochastic blockmodel for directed, weighted networks,
which is conditional on the in- and out-degree distribution.
